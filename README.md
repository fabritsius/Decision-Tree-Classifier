# Decision Tree Classifier
This Handmade Decision Tree Classifier was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg) video.

There is only one reason why it is better than what scikit-learn includes, and it is the fact that I made it myself.
This reason may have smaller importance for you, so feel free to use any other implementation of such classifier.

This code wasn't tested properly, but is supposed to work anyway.
